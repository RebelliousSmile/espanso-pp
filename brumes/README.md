### an alternate way of using Brumes CSS rules inside Obsidian. 

- you can create a tag with `:tag` instruction
- you can create a status with `:status` instruction
- you can create a spectrum with `:mark` instruction
- you can create a description block with `:desc` instruction
- you can create a clue block with `:clue` instruction
- you can create a special clue block with `:sclue` instruction
- you can create a move block  with `:note` instruction (because of obsidian, i couldn't use the cursor rules of espanso, but you can return after title, write the rest of your text, and return two times to close the block)
- you can launch a danger form with `:dangerhtml` instruction
